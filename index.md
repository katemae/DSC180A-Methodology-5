## Brainstorm
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic we've covered in my domain this quarter is the paper [Addition is All You Need for Energy-Efficient Language Models](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.00907).
The implementation of the linear-complexity multiplication algorithm developed in this paper has become the basis for our entire project, simplifying floating point multiplication into an algorithm
that requires less energy and shorter computation time for essentially the same, if not better, precision. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation we would like to pursue in Quarter 2 is the difference in saved energy and computation time when implemented into different GPUs. To take our implementation one step further,
we would also love to see this fully developed into an FPGA, investigating if such an implementation would further save time and resources or if the difference is negligible.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

A potential change I would make to the approach we took during our current Quarter 1 project is more regular communication and collaboration throughout our processes. Because we all have varying skill sets and experience
in regard to this project, most of our team works independently on their designated tasks for the week; as a result, we will share our results and findings during our weekly sessions and then delegate tasks further.
It would be great if we could assign tasks to require more collaboration, though this approach has been proven difficult due to the nature of our project being consistently hard to work together on beyond the divide-and-conquer approach.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Currently, we are working with PyRTL and Vivado to develop our project and deliverables, allowing us to employ a Python implementation alongside the development of HLS for our project.
Something that the group, especially Kai, is excited about is the potential to develop our project into an ASIC.
